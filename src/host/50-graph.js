/* ── the graph under a filter ──

   The plain layout below walks the commits it is handed, so it can only ever
   connect two of them: a parent that the filter hid is not in the list, and the
   lane booked for it is never claimed — the next commit then takes a *fresh*
   lane. Measured on the reader's repository with `fix` typed in the search box
   (200 matching commits): 104 lanes' worth of bookings, capped at 14, a 202px
   column that is mostly empty, 52% of the edges drawn as a one-row stub, and
   the dots marching right until they all pile onto the last lane. Same search,
   same repository, the graph was unreadable — while the plain history drew a
   proper ribbon.

   So a filtered read is laid out on the **real** DAG: the host reads the plain
   hash+parents history for the span the matches cover (measured: 1518 commits
   in 190ms for those 200 rows), lays that out, and then places each visible
   commit on the lane it really holds. An edge is drawn to the nearest *visible*
   ancestor, and marked dashed when commits in between were filtered out —
   IDEA's own reading of a dashed line, and the reason its graph stays a graph
   when a filter is on. Nothing here changes an unfiltered read: that path still
   goes through layoutGraph alone. */
