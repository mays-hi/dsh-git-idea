/* ── whose working directory this request means ──

   A request that names no path of its own is about the session's own working
   directory, which is exactly the directory the shell layer already treats as
   home when no workdir is given. Both questions below are that one lookup: which
   repository this request is about, and where a probe of some *other* path may be
   spawned. A probe must never run with the inspected path as its workdir — when
   that directory does not exist the spawn itself fails before git is ever reached
   and the caller sees a rejected promise instead of the diagnosis it asked for. */

  /* The async resolution that runs before every handler already went to storage
     for a session that is not live (see `withSessionRepo`), and hands the answer
     back on the input. Read it first so every synchronous reader — including a
     probe whose own target does not exist — sees the session's directory. */

/* ── the session's own workspace, resolved before the handler runs ──

   DSH 0.1.7 changed sessions.get(id): it answers for a session that is LIVE in
   this process and nothing else (0.1.5 loaded one from storage). A session the
   reader has just selected is briefly not live while it restores — and one
   selected, switched away from and left there is not live either — so the
   synchronous repoFrom saw no workspace at all and every read answered
   not-a-repository: the panel said「未检测到仓库」while the chip, whose read landed
   a moment later, named the branch.

   So the workspace is resolved once here, before the handler: the live session
   first, its stored header second (sessionPersistence.stat reads the generation
   header without the event log, and never takes ownership). The answer travels
   on the input as sessionCwd — the SESSION's directory, deliberately not the
   requested one, so the probe in 62-panel.js that must not spawn inside a target
   that does not exist keeps the right workdir. */

   Every path the panel sends is one git itself listed, so it is relative to the

   keeps inside the repository on its own. The untracked read cannot: it is
   `git diff --no-index -- /dev/null <path>`, and that command reads whatever the
   path names. Measured here, an absolute path came back with the contents of
   /etc/hostname — a file no reader of a git panel asked for. So anything
   absolute, or stepping up with "..", is refused rather than resolved.

   A NUL byte is refused for a different reason: it survives as far as the shell
   layer, where Node's own `spawn` rejects the argument outright (`ERR_INVALID_ARG_VALUE`,
   measured), so the read would throw instead of answering. */

/* ─────────────── per-repository read cache ───────────────

   Opening the panel used to cost nine child processes and nothing was reused,
   so every open re-read the whole repository. Reads are now memoised per
   repository and dropped on any mutation.

   Reads do not age out on a timer. Data may be as old as the last explicit
   invalidation, which is what makes reopening the panel instant; freshness is
   the watcher's job (git/watch below) plus the mutation and refresh paths.

   A miss stores the *promise*, not the value: two surfaces asking for the same
   read at the same moment — the composer chip's full read, and the panel opening
   under it — are one child process instead of two, which on a slow mount is the
   difference between one seven-second `git status` and two. A rejection is never
   kept, so a read that failed can be attempted again, and the value is only
   stored if the entry is still the promise that produced it: an invalidation
   arriving mid-read must not be undone by that read landing afterwards. */
