/* ── whose sandbox these commands run under ──

   A shell call that names no policy gets the *deployment* default, not the
   session's. Measured on this deployment: the default is `workspace-write` rooted
   at the deployment's own directory (/mnt/c/Users/mayou here) while the session is
   `danger-full-access` — so every writing git command failed with "Permission
   denied" on `.git/index.lock` for any repository outside that one directory,
   while reads were fine and it looked like git refusing to work.

   The session's mode and its cwd are exactly what the reader's own commands run
   under, so they are what this plugin asks for: `sessions` says which session,
   `sandboxPolicy` says what that session resolved to, and a session that is
   read-only keeps this plugin read-only. Without either service the request goes
   out unchanged and the shell layer falls back as before. */

/* ── the one failure that is not about the repository ──

   On a machine with no `git` on PATH every command below dies at the shell, and
   its "command not found" arrives looking exactly like a repository git refused
   to read: `git status` and `git rev-parse` both answer nothing, `$gd` comes out
   empty, and a perfectly good repository is reported as "not a git repository" —
   the one diagnosis the reader cannot act on, with the path field hidden besides.

   So each git command opens with a question about the machine instead. `command
   -v` is a shell builtin, so the check costs no process, and it asks about the
   PATH *this* command will be resolved with — after `LC_ALL=C` and
   `GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0` have been put in front of it, neither of which changes
   which git is found. The marker word and exit code 127 are what the Host reads;
   bash's own sentence is never matched, because it is printed in whatever
   language the machine happens to speak.

   The panel scripts below are the one place this is not enough: they multiplex
   several answers over stdout in a single process (`pathShell`), so they carry
   the same check's answer as an output marker instead of an exit code —
   `PANEL_NO_GIT`. Same question, same builtin, two transports. */

   ending in `fatal: empty ident name`, which says what failed and not one word
   about the two commands that fix it.

   Recognised where it happens rather than matched out of that text: git
   translates it, and it has several spellings (identity absent, an address but
   no name, a guessed address that is not a full domain). The question asked
   instead is `git var GIT_AUTHOR_IDENT` — the same lookup `git commit` makes
   before it writes anything — and a non-zero exit answers "this commit is
   going to be refused" in every locale. It is asked only *after* a commit has
