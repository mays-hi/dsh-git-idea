    /* ── the source bridge, not the plugin itself ──

       The real Host half sits in a file beside the deployment's own settings
       (<DSH_HOME>/dsh-git-idea/host.js) and is evaluated here. A dynamic
       Package is immutable, so every change means submitting the whole thing
       again through the model — and this plugin is far past the size where that
       is a copy rather than a regeneration. The deployment already has a
       mechanism for a plugin that lives in files: a real package ships its Host
       half as lib/ and its Client half as client/client.js. This bridge is that
       layout, loaded by hand, until the plugin moves into a profile bundle.

       Everything the evaluated source registers — tools, RPC handlers, effects
       — belongs to this fiber, so stop, update and undefine still remove all of
       it. Re-running this Package re-reads the file, which is how a change to
       the source is picked up.

       Two things here are not about reading files. The Client half is only handed
       over once the Host half is in: both halves start together and the Client's
       first render asks for git/panel straight away, so a reply that arrived
       first produced a panel whose every request was refused. And the load is
       logged next to the source, because a failure here used to be one line in a
       console nobody reads. */
